# Contributing to Jiffyscan

Welcome to Jiffyscan! We are excited to have you contribute to our open-source project. We welcome all types of contributions, from bug fixes to new features. This document will guide you through the process of contributing to our project.
Getting Started

Before you start contributing, make sure you have the latest version of the code from our repository. You can clone our repository using the following command:

bash

`git clone https://github.com/jiffy-labs/jiffyscan-frontend.git`

and switch to the branch `development`

`git switch development && git pull`

work on development branch and raise a PR to develpoment branch

Once you have the code, you can install the dependencies by running:

`npm install`

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
